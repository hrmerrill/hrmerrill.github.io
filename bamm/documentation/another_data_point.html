    Assimilating more data points.
  </h2>
  <p>I've conducted another NB test and collected a new data point for my AeT: 158 bpm. With this new data point, I want
    to update my estimate for my unknown average AeT. But first, a note: while in my first NB test I used the average
    heart rate of a 30-minute run in which I could breathe comfortably through my nose, in my second test I measured it
    a bit differently: it was the maximum heart rate I could sustain at which I could comfortably breathe through my
    nose for a few minutes at a time. On multiple occasions, I purposefully increased my pace to see the heart rate at
    which I needed to open my mouth for air. Though I conducted this NB test slightly differently, I am already
    accounting for uncertainty in AeT measurements by using Bayesian modeling; specifically, in the previous page I
    assumed a standard deviation of 5 bpm for these measurements. I can then use a conservative estimate for my AeT
    (e.g., the lower 10% quantile), and define my Zone 2 using this number. I am therefore not concerned about my
    results being influenced by changing my measurement protocol, because I am already properly accounting for
    uncertainty in these measurements and choosing conservative estimates for my AeT.</p>
  <p>With multiple data points, the math for the posterior distribution changes a bit. Recall the prior distribution of
    my average AeT:</p>
  <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\text{AeT}\sim&space;N(130,\sigma_{AeT}^2)" height="30px">
  <p>We describe the likelihood of observing a number of heart rates using the nose-breathing test (denoted
    <em>y<sup>(i)</sup><sub>NB</sub></em> for <em>i=1,...,n</em>) conditional on a true but unknown average AeT value
    similarly as before, but for convenience we will assume the standard deviation is the same as that of the AeT:</p>
  <img
    src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?y^{(i)}_{NB}|\text{AeT}\sim&space;N(\text{AeT},\sigma_{AeT}^2),\quad&space;i=1,...,n"
    height="30px">
  <p>What we want is the distribution of AeT|<em>y<sup>(i)</sup><sub>NB</sub></em>; that is, the distribution of my
    average AeT given the data points I've collected using the nose-breathing test. The math is skipped, but the
    posterior distribution of AeT given the data points is</p>
  <img
    src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\text{AeT}|y^{(i)}_{NB}\sim&space;N\left(\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n&space;y_i&plus;130}{n&plus;1},\frac{\sigma^2_{AeT}}{n&plus;1}\right)"
    height="60px">
  <p>Plugging in our numbers, we get</p>
  <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\text{AeT}|y^{(i)}_{NB}\sim&space;N\left(145.33,2.89\right)"

  <p>This page is here to illustrate that as I keep collecting measurements, the posterior distribution will keep
    narrowing. However, I now have a better idea of my AeT based on the nose-breathing test, and I won't continue to
    measure it this way. I will perform endurance training using 140 at my AeT. I have ordered a lactate testing kit,
    which will allow me to collect more data, do different modeling, and get a more precise estimate of my AeT.</p>
