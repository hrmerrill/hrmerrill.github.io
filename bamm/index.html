    <strong>Bayesian Assessment of Metabolic Markers</strong>
    BAMM
  </h2>
  <p>I received <a href="https://uphillathlete.com/product/training-for-the-uphill-athlete-book/">Training for the
      Uphill Athlete</a> as a gift and found myself particularly interested in estimating my aerobic and lactate
    thresholds (AeT and LT, respectively). This site is probably best thought of as a journal or lab notebook where I
    can document my measurements and thought process, and more generally, as another outlet in which I can exercise my
    compulsion to do data science.</p>

  <p>Estimates of my aerobic threshold (AeT), lactate threshold (LT), and maximum heart rates.</p>
  <p>For information about these metabolic markers and how they are useful for endurance training, see <a
      href=https://uphillathlete.com/aerobic-training/aerobic-anaerobic-threshold-self-assessment />this article</a>.
  </p>
  <p>I intend to update these estimates as I collect more data and as I progress in my endurance training. For a full
    description of my measurements and methodology, see <a href=documentation/index.html>this page</a>.</p>
