    <p>I received <a href="https://uphillathlete.com/product/training-for-the-uphill-athlete-book/">Training for the Uphill Athlete</a> as a gift and found myself particularly interested in estimating my aerobic and lactate thresholds (AeT and LT, respectively). This page is probably best thought of as a journal or lab notebook where I can document my measurements and thought process, and more generally, as an outlet in which I can exercise my compulsion to do data science.</p>
    <p>To obtain estimates of each metabolic marker, I'm mostly following the methods outlined in the book and described <a href=https://uphillathlete.com/aerobic-training/aerobic-anaerobic-threshold-self-assessment/>here</a>. I'm also using Bayesian methods to quantify the uncertainty around these estimates, because estimates without some quantification of their uncertainty are, in my opinion, useless.</p>
